Ideas to implement:

1. Be able to add pictures and text to points on the map.
2. Be able to drag points around during creation.
3. Be able to link to the map visually (like google maps).
4. Have unclickable mile/km markers on the path
5. A good refactoring in the JS is that we don't need the points array.  A polyline object is all we need.  It contains all the vertices.
